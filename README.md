ABG Motors – ML Prediction Model
📌 Introduction

This project aims to predict potential car buyers for ABG Motors using Machine Learning. A Logistic Regression model was developed and trained on a Japan customer dataset, then tested on an India dataset to evaluate its adaptability across different markets. This project combines statistical modeling with data visualization to deliver actionable business insights.

📊 Objective

Build a classification model to predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing a car.

Apply the trained model from one market (Japan) to another (India) for cross-country generalization.

Compare purchase behavior across countries using Tableau dashboards.

🔹 Methodology

Data Preprocessing – Cleaned and prepared customer demographic and behavioral attributes.

Modeling – Implemented Logistic Regression for binary classification (Buyer vs. Non-Buyer).

Evaluation – Assessed model accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliability.

Cross-Dataset Testing – Applied the Japan-trained model to India’s dataset to measure performance differences.

Visualization – Designed Tableau dashboards for KPI tracking and comparative analysis.

📈 Key Insights

Logistic Regression provided interpretable results, highlighting significant factors influencing purchase decisions.

The model’s performance varied between Japan and India, revealing differences in customer behavior.

Tableau dashboards offered interactive visual comparisons of KPIs such as purchase probability, customer demographics, and cross-country trends.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Logistic Regression (Classification)

Visualization: Tableau (Dashboards for comparative insights)

🚀 Business Impact
